# Purpose
Errors have been found in the HL7 SDTC extensions, and HL7 have been notified. 

The main goal of this feature is to temporarily fix the HL7 SDTC extensions and introduce them into the validator. 
Once HL7 have fixed the SDTC extensions, the validator will be changed back to using the non-temporary version of the XSDs.
